1. Unit Testing - testing units/methods in isolation (check mo yung ingredients)
2. Integration Testing - when you test how different parts of your program work together
not just in isolation or by individual tests (gawa ka ng dish gamit ingredients)
3. System Testing - Testing the whole system with respect to the requirements and compliance,
ensuring that all parts are working as intended and everything is functional (buong meal na)
4. Acceptance - testing if the system meets and satisfies the needs of the user, and the requirements set during the
start of the development phase (masarap ba yung niluto sabi ng mga nakatikim?)
5. False, it is the expected value.
6. JUnit Jupiter
7. assertEquals(expected, actual) - asserts if expected is same as actual
8. assertNotEquals(expected, actual) - asserts if expected is not the same as actual
9. assertTrue(condition) - assert that condition is true
10. assertNull(object) - assert that object is null
